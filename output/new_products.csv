BLRCH104A125B48,"heavy duty PowerLogic PFC Capacitor, 10.4/12.5 kvar - 480 V - 50/60Hz","VarPlus Can capacitor are a reliable and flexible solution for power factor correction in stringent operating conditions. These capacitors are particularly used for higher voltage disturbances or when a few non-linear loads are present. The rated current of the capacitors must be in increased in order to cope with the circulation of the harmonic current. This capacitor provides a rated output power of 10.4 kVar at 480V AC, 50 Hz. Fastening assured by a ClampTite terminal. This component meet the standards IEC 60831-1 and IEC 60831-2. The case product weight is 1.2 kg.
