BCPMC224S,"BCPM power monitoring basic - 24 solid core 100 A - 18 mm CT spacing","This is an integrated solution for monitoring multi-circuits and mains by using a single meter. The meter is designed for use in new build and is used for critical power operations in data centres and energy management in buildings. It offers class 1 (1 %) power and energy system accuracy (100A solid core current transformers) on all branch channels. The BCPM monitors only the 24 branch circuits current. All to provide information on the complete Power Distribution Unit. Full alarming capabilities ensure that potential issues are dealt with before they become problems. Communication enabled with a RS485 serial port and the Modbus protocol support, more communication options with the gateway H8951. The meter need to be powered by a 90V AC to 277V AC supply source. Include 2 18-CTs board strips with 18mm spacing between each CT connectors, for 24 circuits. The device dimensions are 228mm in width, 146mm in height and weight 1.5 kilograms.
